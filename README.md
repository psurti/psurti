I'm a senior software engineer focused on building **scalable, high-performance systems** that combine **human expertise with intelligent automation**. My work sits at the intersection of **distributed systems, AI/GenAI, and real-world production engineering**.

I design and build platforms where **humans and machines collaborate**—from rule-based and data-driven systems to AI-assisted decision engines—always with an emphasis on correctness, explainability, and long-term maintainability.
